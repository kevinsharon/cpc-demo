		<h1>A Github Primer</h1>
		<h2>Created for Central Park Conservancy</h2>
		<h3>Presented: June 20, 2017</h3>
		<h4>What you will be able to do after today:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Understand terms like: repository, push, pull, commit, and more!</li>
			<li>Create and use a repository</li>
			<li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
			<li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
			<li>Open and merge a pull request</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Getting Started</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to github.com and sign up for an account</li>
				<li>Go to desktop.github.com and download the GitHub desktop app</li>
				<li>Install the app, open it and sign in</li>
			</ol>
		
		<h4>Create a Repository</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Select File > New Repository</li>
				<li>Name it "cpcDemoJune2017"</li>
				<li>Select Initialize this repository with a README</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now you have a code repository (or "repo") to work with. This comes with a default branch called "Master". We're going to add an exiting file to this branch and make some changes to it</p>
		
		<h4>Committing</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Open index.html</li>
				<li>Change text and save file</li>
				<li>In GitHub app view your changes, add a summary and commit to master</li>
				<li>Select Publish</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Your changes are not committed to GitHub and the Master branch now has the latest code. Others working on the branch should now Fetch origin to get the latest code.</p>
			
			<h4>Branches</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Select Branch > New Branch</li>
				<li>Name the new Branch "production" (all lowercase)</li>
				<li>Select production under current branch</li>
				<li>Open the index.html, make a change and save it, and commit your changes to the production branch</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Multiple developers can work with the same repo, within their own branch or on a shared branch. If you're developing specific featues on the site you can create a branch just for working in that new feature. The other developers won't see that feature unless they work in that branch or you branch gets Merged into the master branch.</p>
